Stable Match Counting : 

This project uses brute force to find all the possible stable matches possible in an nxn Matrix.

Gale-Shapley algorithm always give you one stable match but in order to check if other matches are possible this project can come in handy.

Limitations:  Does not handle 11! or above very easily. Need a bigger machine to get the most out of it since complexity grows 
extremely fast due to factorial growth.
